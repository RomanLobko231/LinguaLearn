-- LinguaLearn --

A language learning app that I made as a small gift particularly for my girlfriend, since she wanted to learn Spanish. 
- A core concept and study flow is as follows: a user has to start a new day every day before studying so the progress can be followed. Later on when our user comes upon unknown word in target language, they open the app, translate the word to their mothertongue and save this new pair in the current day. 
- LinguaLearn also offers a training functionality: a user clicks on training and has to correctly translate recently learnt words. A hint can be used on difficult questions. After training user gets a certain amount of XP-points according to their performance, which may encourage them to continue learning.
It uses a third-party API(https://api.mymemory.translated.net/) that helps in translating words that a user wants to save.

Application's target languages are currently Ukrainian|Spanish, although they can be changed with functionality I plan to add in the next update.
